eat_ramen: Use the same character and setting as the i2i frame; preserve identity exactly (face, hair, eyes, skin tone, outfit, accessories) with no changes. Vertical 9:16. Single-shot, no cuts. Camera: gentle 10–15% slow push-in with subtle handheld micro-movements; keep face and bowl fully in frame at all times. Atmosphere: warm tungsten lantern glow, soft bokeh of paper lanterns and noren, faint rainy street reflections; heavy steam that swirls and curls around the face. Action timing (8s): 0–1s: character seated at the wooden counter, steam rising, relaxed breathing. 1–3s: lift noodles with chopsticks; noodles glisten and bounce slightly; bowl hand steady with light condensation. 3–4s: small inhale, gentle blow to cool; steam eddies toward camera. 4–6s: quiet slurp; eyes soften, tiny pleased eyebrow lift; minimal head tilt to keep framing. 6–7s: set a few noodles back, small sip of broth. 7–8s (ending beat): content exhale into rising steam and a warm cozy smile toward camera; hold for a half-second as steam swirls across frame. Environmental details: subtle lantern flicker, soft reflections, no logos or text. Motion style: smooth, natural, unhurried; maintain single subject, no costume changes.
