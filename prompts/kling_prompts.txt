japaneseNoodleShop: Use the input anime portrait as the character. Preserve face, hair, skin tone, outfit, and overall style exactly; don't add accessories. Scene: the coziest Japanese ramen shop in the world—warm 2700K lighting, paper lanterns, cedar counter, noren curtain, fogged window with gentle rain outside, subtle vinyl crackle ambience. Steam rises richly from a deep ceramic bowl (tonkotsu or shoyu—your choice) topped with chashu, scallions, ajitama, nori, sesame. Condensation beads on a water glass. Action (one seamless shot, 8–10s): character lifts noodles with chopsticks, lets them glisten and drip, then slurps warmly; cheeks relax, eyes brighten; a tiny satisfied exhale fogs the air; finishes with a cozy smile and a small nod. Camera: intimate tabletop framing at a ramen counter, 35mm look, shallow depth (≈f/1.8) for creamy bokeh; start on bowl (rack focus) → slow dolly/handheld micro-jitter toward face as slurp happens → slight tilt to follow steam swirl. Keep framing centered, no cuts. Vibe: ultra-cozy, food-porn details, gentle steam plumes, rich bokeh from lanterns. Constraints: single subject only, no brand logos or text, no chibi exaggeration, no mess on face or clothing. Maintain character identity from the source image. Silent video is fine; no lip-sync needed.
